# Depix - Frontend Challenge

Interested in joining us? Try this challenge and show us your Frontend skills!

## How to participate?

The submission and reviewing process is handled by Github Classroom.

To join this challenge and submit your application, please follow this [invitation link](https://classroom.github.com/a/lyGOwjiI).
It will ask you to accept the assignment and your repository will be automatically created once accepted.

In your repository, a `feedback` branch and a `Feedback` Pull Request will be already created. Please, use this branch and Pull Request to show us your
changes. Your submission will be reviewed only if you use this Pull Request.

Once ready, please tag one of the [code owners](./CODEOWNERS) of this repository and they'll review your application when possible.

## Challenge Instructions

The instructions are directly coded in the web application. So head to [hello-js](./hello-js) (React Javascript project) or [hello-ts](./hello-ts) (React Typescript project) and follow the steps to start the application. Then open the web app and you'll see the instructions.

Enjoy!
